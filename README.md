For practicing Github flow and going a step forward in the programming journey!

## Presentation

Hello, world! My name is Guilherme Nascimento Braga, which might sound a bit weird for english speakers, but you'll get the hang of it! I'm 24 years old, love maths and science of all fields, and I've just I'm in the second semester of what you'd call a college major in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence!

Our first semester was challenging, but I've nailed it. Learned the basics of Algorithms on Python, some Data Visualization and Analysis with Pandas, SKlearn, and had classes on Calculus and Discrete Maths. Now, we're studying Object Oriented Programming with C++ and Data Structure on the same language, as well as studying Probabilities. This GitHub account is for setting up an environment for submiting assignments, as well as perhaps building a portfolio. Currently I also work in a State Bank, but I dream of switching carreers to something more programming related.

I believe this sums it up well. I'll continue the hello-world tutorial, and hope to upload some cool stuff to this repository! See y'all later!
